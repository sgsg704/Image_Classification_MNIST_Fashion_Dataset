# Image_Classification_MNIST_Fashion_Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST clothing classification problem is a new standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.  Although the dataset is relatively simple, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification from scratch. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, how to explore improvements to the model, and how to save the model and later load it to make predictions on new data.


The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of small, 28 x 28 pixels, grayscale images of clothes that is annotated with a label indicating the correct garment. Read more about Fashion MNIST here:  Zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist 


Fashion MNIST Clothing Classification
The Fashion-MNIST dataset is proposed as a more challenging replacement dataset for the MNIST dataset.

It is a dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.

It is a more challenging classification problem than MNIST and top results are achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks with a classification accuracy of about 90% to 95% on the hold out test dataset.
