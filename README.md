# Image_Classification_MNIST_Fashion_Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST clothing classification problem is a new standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.  Although the dataset is relatively simple, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification from scratch. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, how to explore improvements to the model, and how to save the model and later load it to make predictions on new data
